# Neo AltCoin Analysis Data
## Purpose
* I started with the assumption that the price of alt-coins is directly correlated with the price of BTC.
* I followed this assumption with the assumption that for certain level of BTC pricing NEO should move between a given range of minimum and maximum pricing.
* I believed that the above reasoning could help me identify if Neo was over or underpriced.
## What was implemented
* A jupyter notebook that plots NEO Prices againts BTC prices and a timeline
